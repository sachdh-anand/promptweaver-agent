# Blueprint for an AI Prompt Engineering Agent

This document outlines the requirements and principles for building a world-class AI Prompt Engineering Agent. It serves as a source for Docling-based knowledge ingestion in CrewAI.

---

## 1. Cognitive Alignment and User Intent Interpretation

- Understand the user's core intent and semantic nuances.
- Use NLU for deep parsing and map human intent to LLM capabilities.
- Categorize input based on domain, specificity, and complexity.

---

## 2. Dynamic Framework Selection and Combination

- Dynamically select frameworks based on the prompt characteristics.
- Combine methods from: PECRA, RTF, RISEN, BAB, 5Ws+1H, GRADE, Alex Formula.
- Maintain a framework library and use rules or LLMs to match them.

---

## 3. Comprehensive Context Integration

- Include explicit, implicit, and real-time temporal context.
- Use knowledge graphs or APIs to enrich prompt content.
- Prioritize detail to improve model precision.

---

## 4. Persona and Style Adaptation

- Generate prompts that reflect the desired persona or tone.
- Allow user-driven or context-driven style selection.
- Learn and reapply user-preferred styles over time.

---

## 5. Continuous Optimization through Feedback

- Track performance of prompts and corresponding model responses.
- Incorporate feedback loops (explicit and implicit).
- Use Reinforcement Learning or prompt rewriting models to improve over time.

---

## 6. Generation of Clear, Specific, and Structured Instructions

- Prioritize clear instructions over constraints.
- Decompose complex tasks into clear steps.
- Specify output format: JSON, XML, bullets, paragraphs.
- Include few-shot examples, edge cases, and role assignments.
- Use Chain of Thought reasoning (e.g., “think step-by-step”).
- Use variables/placeholders for reusability.
- Experiment with prompt element ordering.

---

## 7. Security and Robustness

- Prevent prompt injection and adversarial inputs.
- Sanitize input and output content.

---

## 8. Seamless LLM Integration

- Ensure prompt is compatible with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini).
- Format output using system/user/assistant roles or markup when required.

---

By applying these principles, the system can consistently generate prompts with the clarity, structure, and adaptability of expert-level human engineers.
