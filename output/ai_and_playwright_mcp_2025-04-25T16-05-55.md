# AI-Powered Playwright Test Automation Master Control Program

## 🎯 Objective
Leverage PECRA framework (Purpose, Expectation, Context, Request, Action) to create self-optimizing Playwright test suites that:
- Auto-generate context-aware test scripts
- Execute cross-browser/device tests with intelligent retries
- Refine locators using ML-based element recognition
- Generate human-readable reports with root-cause analysis

## 🤖 Agent Roles
1. **Test Architect** 🧠  
   - Define test strategy using OODA loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act)  
   - Maintain cross-browser compatibility matrix
   - Set performance benchmarks

2. **Script Engineer** ⚙️  
   - Implement Page Object Model 2.0 with AI-generated selectors  
   - Apply RISEN framework for resilient test flows  
   - Integrate visual regression thresholds

3. **Quality Analyst** 🔍  
   - Design SCQA-based test cases (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)  
   - Validate accessibility audits (WCAG 2.1+ compliance)  
   - Monitor flakiness index

4. **DevOps Integrator** 🌐  
   - Optimize parallel execution grids  
   - Manage test environment provisioning  
   - Implement CI/CD feedback loops

## 🔄 Workflow Steps (ITERATE Cycle)
1. **I**nventory: Audit existing test coverage using Modified Condition Coverage criteria
2. **T**riage: Prioritize test scenarios via Risk-Based Testing matrix
3. **E**ngine: Generate scripts using Hybrid AI (GPT-4 + Codex) with multi-locator fallbacks
4. **R**un: Execute tests across predefined browser/os matrix with adaptive timeouts
5. **A**nalyze: Perform failure root-cause analysis using decision trees
6. **T**une: Apply multi-armed bandit algorithm for test suite optimization
7. **E**volve: Update Knowledge Graph with execution patterns

## 🚨 Error Handling (HEAL Protocol)
| Error Type          | Detection Method              | Resolution                     | Fallback Procedure                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Element Locators     | Computer Vision + DOM Diff    | Contextual Selector Regeneration | XPath/CSS/Alt-Text Cascade          |
| Async Operations     | Execution Timeline Analysis   | Dynamic Wait Reinforcement     | Event Listener Injection            |
| Browser Crashes      | Heartbeat Monitoring          | Session Recycling              | Browser Stack Fallback Activation   |
| Data Dependencies    | API Response Validation       | Mock Service Restoration        | Test Data Generation via GAN        |
| Visual Regressions   | Perceptual Hash Comparison    | Baseline Image Calibration      | Delta Analysis Report Generation    |

**Escalation Path**: 3 retries → Local Fix → Cloud Sandbox → Human Alert
